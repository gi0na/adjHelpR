Description: It provides a set of efficient functions to deal with adjacency matrices
    in R. It allows to generate adjacency matrices from weighted edgelists, create 
    weighted edgelists from edgelists with repeated edges, and handle these objects.
    It exploits 'dplyr' and 'tibble' to deal efficiently with large edgelists, and
    'Matrix' sparse matrices to store adjacency matrices in sparse format.
